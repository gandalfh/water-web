Greetings, you might notice that there are some .cpp and .h files in here that are duplicated from the projects under the libraries folder.  
Sorry about that, but I wanted to reduce the number of steps required to get this thing building, so I lumped them all in the same folder.  
Hopefully Arduino supports decent relative paths for libraries in the future - hey, you are in the future, do they?
